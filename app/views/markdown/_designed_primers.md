Primers for wheat SNP-Chips
===========================

The following files contain designed primers to known markers

Wheat Axiom 820k
----------------
The Axiom chip was developed by the WISP, for further information go [here](http://www.cerealsdb.uk.net/cerealgenomics/CerealsDB/axiom_820K_search.php)
  
* **[Located against Chinese Spring RefSeq 1.0](files/820k_axiom/all_axiom_markers_refseq.csv.zip)**. The markers where extracted from [ensembl plants, release 40](ftp://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/plants/release-40/vcf/triticum_aestivum/triticum_aestivum.vcf.gz). 

The primers where designed against the pseudomolecules described in IWGSC(2018)[1]. 

Wheat iSelect 90k
-----------------
The markers in this section are from the Illumina iSelect chip described in Wang (2014)[2]. 

* **[Located against CSS](files/iSelect/primers_all.csv.zip)** 81,587 SNPs located according to the best hit to the scaffolds from the IWGSC[3] 
* **[Genetically mapped](files/iSelect/primers_in_map.csv.zip)** 46,977 SNPs located according to the genetic map.

The primers were designed against the soft-masked reference as released in ensembl plants IWGSC1[3]. For an updated version of the primers, please look at the primers of the Wheat Axiom 820k section above, which contains the SNPs in the iSelect chip.
