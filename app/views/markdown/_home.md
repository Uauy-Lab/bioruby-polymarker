===============

PolyMarker is an automated bioinformatics pipeline for SNP assay development which increases the probability of generating homoeologue-specific assays for polyploid species. PolyMarker generates a multiple alignment between the target SNP sequence and the selected reference genome (from the drop off menu in green below). It then generates a mask with informative polymorphic positions between homoeologs which are highlighted with respect to the target genome.

See [About](/about) to know how to prepare your input. For wheat, we have [designed primers](/designed_primers) for the iSelect 90K chip and the Axiom 820k chip.

**Please only submit 10 primers per request**
